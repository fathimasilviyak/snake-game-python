Snake was an incredibly popular game, mostly remembered from the 1990s era cell phones. For many people, it was the only game on their phone at that time. 

In the most basic form, it's a super simple game, but still strangely entertaining.

It's also a great game to learn the basics of game making from.

The snake game has a moving snake which can be controlled using the keyboard.

The snake can go and get food.

It grows in length as it eats more food.  

Each time it eats the food, the score gets increased by one.

When the snake head hits the the wall or any part of its body then the game over.

The goal is to eat as much food as it can while staying alive, so that it will get maximum score.

Snake game is implemented using turtle, a python library.
